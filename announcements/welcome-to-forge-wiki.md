# Welcome to Forge Wiki

Hello and welcome to Forge Wiki! Thank you for taking the time to read our first announcement blog. We're excited that you're here because we too are just as excited for the beta release of Halo Infinite's Forge! I'm sure you're asking yourself several questions on what is Forge Wiki and how does it fit into the Halo community. It's simple, Forge has grown from a small in-game editor in Halo 3 to something that truly needs formal documentation and that's what we hope we can deliver. Quality tutorials, documentation and Forge support.

So let's dive into some questions on what Forge Wiki is and how you, the community, can help.

## Why is the site called 'Forge Wiki' when it's clearly not a wiki?

I wanted to approach Forge Wiki by developing an 'Official' documentation website, while maintaining the benefits of public collaboration that wiki-based websites offer to the community. However, Forge Wiki is not affiliated with 343 Industries or Microsoft. Read more on our [General Disclaimer](https://www.forgewiki.com/resources/general-disclaimer) page.

Most official documentation sites aren't written in a wiki. They're either developed on websites like Confluence or hosted within an official website. In some cases like this one, Forge Wiki is neither and took the approach of developing documentation within a git repository in the form of markdown files. With sites like [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) (website host), it takes the formatted markdown files and beautifies them into easily consumable pages. While the formatting may take some getting used to, it loads fast, the search function is fantastic, and reading on mobile is quite helpful as well.

## Who can contribute to Forge Wiki?

Well, anyone can! Whether it's labeling out objects, writing script tutorials or embedding a video to further explain how to create a prefab, this is what Forge Wiki is meant for.

We understand that documenting takes time and effort from community members, but comments are helpful too! If something isn't formatted correctly or bug was fixed in a later release, contributing by identifying invalid statements is **100%** okay!

If contributing sounds like something you're interested in, check it out [here](https://www.forgewiki.com/contributors/how-can-i-help/documenting).

## When can we start documenting?

Forge Wiki will not consider any documentation until the beta release of Halo Infinite Forge, which is slated to release with the [Winter Update on November 8th 2022](https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halo-infinite-update-september-2022). At this time, any content from the leaked build of Halo Infinite Forge will not be considered. Once Halo Infinite Forge is released, all documentation will be accepted AFTER the Forge Wiki site has been updated with a predefined site layout.

If you wish to discuss more about Forge Wiki and what documentation you hope to create or see, join the discussion on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/7J4A6a2f8k).

## What can you do until the release date?

You can follow [@ForgeWiki](https://twitter.com/forgewiki) on Twitter, [@ForgeWiki](https://www.instagram.com/forgewiki/) on Instagram and we've setup a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuwFo8UDYYmQjew3EKfO50g) channel for creating tutorial videos.

If you're already a fan or would like to contribute to funding the site, check out our [Merch](https://merch.forgewiki.com/) and [Donation](https://www.forgewiki.com/contributors/how-can-i-help/donate) pages. I definitely already appreciate the support you have given by getting this far and I hope to fund Forge Wiki for the years to come with the community's support.

You can join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/7J4A6a2f8k) and build Forge Wiki into the tool that will help content creators deliver the best the Halo community has seen yet.
